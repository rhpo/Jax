# Jax

Jax, the easiest way to write html code for your websites, anonymously, easily, and securely; 


## What is it ?
Jax is an Updated version of Html.
***Example of Hello world in Jax:***
```html
!DOCTYPE $html;

* Add a class to the body...
body.everything-centered
    div.v-align
        h1 Hello, World!
        
```
The __Equivalent__ of the last Example in **HTML** is:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!--Add a class to the body...-->
<body class="everything-centered">
    <div class="v-align">
        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    </div>
</body>

```

## Why Jax ?
***HTML*** was invented by [Tim Berners-Lee](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) in **1993**, so it's made a long ago, 
<br>
which means that it can be improved, simplified and upgraded, so **Jax** came out with 
<br>
a very basic syntax, more secure, advanced, and multi-fuctional.


## How to use Jax in the Command Line ?
